    <h1>Open Spaces for creative minds</h1>
    <p>Looking for an open space where you can connect and learn something new?</p><br>
    <p>As an artist I often find myself home alone drawing, not interacting with other people and all by my one. But actually I want to 
        share my knowledge. 
        Also I'm interested in learning new ways to express myself . The idea is a place for meeting people of 
        different kind of interests, there they can connect and create something new. 
        So this petition is about to evolve this idea as a legal public space on places the city usually doesn't use anymore. </p>

    <p>So please sign up, if you want to support this idea!</p>
